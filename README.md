# IT Communication Toolkit: Bridging Minds Through Inclusive Strategies

This toolkit is designed to help you continue applying the principles and techniques learned in our "Picture This: IT Communication Breakthroughs with Dixit" workshop. Use these resources to strengthen communication, embrace neurodiversity, and improve feedback in your IT team.

## Quick Reference Guides

### SBI Feedback Framework Templates

#### Standard SBI Template

```
Situation: "During [specific event/time/place]..."
Behavior: "I observed that you [specific actions without judgment]..."
Impact: "This resulted in [effects on team/project/individuals]..."
```


#### Neurodiversity-Adapted SBI Template

```
Situation: "During [specific context]..."
Behavior: "I observed [specific action]..."
Impact: "This affected [team members/workflow] by..."
Adaptation: "A helpful adjustment might be..."
```


### Neurodiversity Communication Checklist

- [ ] Provide written summaries of meetings and decisions
- [ ] Use clear and direct language, avoiding idioms and abstract concepts
- [ ] Offer multiple communication channels (visual, written, verbal)
- [ ] Allow processing time before expecting responses
- [ ] Create structured agendas with clear expectations
- [ ] Minimize sensory distractions during important discussions
- [ ] Follow up verbal instructions with written documentation[^5]


## Practical Application Tools

### Communication Preferences Card

```
My name:
Preferred communication method: [e.g., email, chat, face-to-face]
Response time expectations:
Best way to provide me feedback:
Potential challenges I experience:
Helpful accommodations:
```


### Team Communication Agreement Template

Create a living document that establishes:

- Meeting protocols (agendas, notes, facilitation)
- Communication channel purposes (when to use chat vs. email vs. meetings)
- Feedback norms and expectations
- Accessibility considerations for neurodivergent team members[^2]


## Digital Resources \& Tools

### Recommended Applications

- **Visual Collaboration**: Miro, Mural, FigJam
- **Meeting Planning**: SessionLab, Google Sheets
- **Engagement Tools**: Mentimeter, Slido
- **Communication Platforms**: Slack (with accessibility features enabled)[^1]


### Dixit-Inspired Communication Activities

#### "Card-Based Retrospectives"

1. Select Dixit cards representing sprint experiences
2. Share interpretations focusing on communication challenges
3. Use SBI framework to discuss improvements

#### "Feedback Visualization"

1. Create a bank of Dixit cards
2. When providing feedback, select a card that metaphorically represents the situation
3. Use the visual as a shared reference point for discussion

## Understanding Neurodiversity

### Key Considerations by Cognitive Style

| Cognitive Style | Communication Strengths | Potential Challenges | Helpful Adaptations |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Autism Spectrum | Detail-oriented, logical precision, pattern recognition | Idioms, implicit meaning, sensory overload | Clear instructions, written communication, sensory-friendly environments |
| ADHD | Creative connections, enthusiasm, multitasking | Sustained focus in meetings, information recall | Visual aids, breaks, chunked information |
| Dyslexia | Big-picture thinking, verbal communication | Written documentation, text-heavy resources | Audio/visual alternatives, color-coding |

### Creating Neuroinclusive Environments

- Establish clear guidelines for communication
- Regularly gather feedback on communication effectiveness
- Recognize and value different communication styles
- Use multiple tools to accommodate diverse needs[^5][^8]


## Ongoing Development

### Self-Assessment Questions

- How have I adapted my communication style for different team members?
- What feedback techniques have been most effective?
- Which communication channels work best for different types of information?
- How am I creating space for neurodivergent perspectives?


### Resources for Further Learning

- Neurodiversity in the Workplace Toolkit (Communicate Inclusively)[^8]
- Internal Communications Platforms like Workshop[^4]
- Books on neurodiversity in technical environments
- Communication training resources through professional organizations

**Remember**: The strategies in this toolkit are starting points. Continue to adapt your approach based on individual preferences and team dynamics. Effective communication is an ongoing practice, not a destination.
